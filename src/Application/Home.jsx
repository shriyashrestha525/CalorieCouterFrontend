                <p>Calorie Counter App leverages advanced deep learning models to accurately identify food items and provide precise nutritional information. We have experimented with multiple CNN architectures to ensure the best possible performance. Our basic CNN model achieved an accuracy of 48%, offering a foundational approach to food recognition. By implementing InceptionV3, a more sophisticated model known for its deep architecture and efficient feature extraction, we improved accuracy to 66%. Finally, we adopted MobileNetV2, a lightweight yet powerful model optimized for mobile devices, achieving an impressive 74% accuracy. With these AI-driven enhancements, our app ensures reliable food detection, helping users effortlessly track their calorie intake and make informed dietary choices.</p>
